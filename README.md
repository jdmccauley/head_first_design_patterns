# Head First Design Patterns, 2nd Ed

This is where I store my notes on this book, [Head First Design Patterns, 2nd Ed](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/).

Note that while the book has code written in Java, I'm implenting in Python so I can learn to better apply the design patterns to my own work (which is often in Python).
